Airbnb Instant Booking Eligibility Prediction

ABSTRACT:
The travel and tourism industry are one of the world&#39;s great industrial sectors. It drives
economic growth, creates jobs, improves social development, and promotes peace.
Hundreds of millions of people around the world are dependent on the sector for their
employment. A classification model can provide valuable insights for the travelling
industry and help travel companies improve their customer experience, marketing and
promotional efforts, fraud prevention measures, inventory management, and safety
and security measures. Iâ€™m building a classification model that assists hosts in
determining the instant bookability of their property on an online booking platform.
The model will help hosts improve the performance, pricing, and amenities of their
property to increase the likelihood of it being instantly bookable
